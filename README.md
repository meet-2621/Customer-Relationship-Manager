# Customer-Relationship-Manager
I  recently developed a lightweight Customer Relationship Manager (CRM) using only frontend technologies. This project allows users to efficiently manage customer data without a backend or database.
✅ Key Features:

Add, edit, delete, and view customer records

Real-time search functionality

Data persistence using localStorage

Clean and responsive UI

Built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

💡 This project helped me enhance my skills in DOM manipulation, data handling with localStorage, and UI/UX design. It's a great example of how much can be achieved with just frontend tools!
